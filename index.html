      <p>Howdy! I'm a student at Gray Area's Creative Code Immersive program, and a member of the Spring 2017 cohort. I've previously worked in many industries, tech being one of them, and I'm looking to up my own coding game to get into creating my own interactive art installations.</p>

      <h1><a href="https://jlachenal.github.io/jessica-ccimmersive/meme%20challenge/">April 15th, 2017: Build a Meme Website</a></h1>
      <h2>Learning the basics of HTML and CSS.</h2>
      <p>As a class, we were paired up and asked to build a website dedicated to a meme. My partner, Chloe, and I decided to build a website dedicated to the classical art meme, "Joseph Ducreux Archaic Rap," wherein rap lyrics that have been translated into an "olde-English" style are laid on top of a portrait of Joseph Ducreux.</p>
